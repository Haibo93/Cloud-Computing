### About: 
FPF Solution is providing a demostration of dynamically generated REST API which has a set of Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) services. The responses also conform to REST standards such as the status codes. Apart from that, it will also make use of an external REST service and a cloud database to complement the application's functionality and accessing persistent information. Simple user account and access management with hash-based authentication is also included in this demo. To enforce further security of our applicaton, it would be served over https. 

__Note:__ The project is still in development and not all features and services are implemented on the front-end side. To test the functinoalities, we recommend using [insomnia](insomnia.rest).
