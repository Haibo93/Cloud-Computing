# Cloud-Computing
## Marks:
The application provides a dynamically generated REST API. The API must have a sufficient set of services for the selected application domain. The REST API responses must conform to REST standards (e.g. response codes).  3 Points

The application makes use of an external REST service to complement its functionality. 3 Points

The application uses a cloud database for accessing persistent information. 3 Points

The application code is well documented (in each of the code files, as well as in the README.MD file of the git repository). 1 Point

Option 1: 5 points for demonstration of load balancing/scaling of the application (e.g. Kubernetes based load balancing/GKE). In order to get the full 5 marks, the student must demonstrate (in the video presentation) the effect in practice of these techniques.

Option 2: Up to 5 for any 3 implementations as mentioned below:
Serving the application over https.
Implementing hash-based authentication.
Implementing user accounts and access management.
Securing the database with role-based policies.

Option 3: Up to 5 points: Anything else that would be relevant to a cloud application (needs to be pre-approved by Sukhpal - contact through email first).
